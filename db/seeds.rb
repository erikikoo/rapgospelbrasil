# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
   #Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
  require "as-duration"
   for i in 1..20
   		#Email.create(artist_data_id: 9, email: Faker::Internet.email)
   		#Phone.create(artist_data_id: 9, telefone: Faker::PhoneNumber.phone_number)
